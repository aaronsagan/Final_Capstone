## How to Test

📦 Raw charity channel data: []
✅ Active charity channels found: 0 []
```
+ Warning toast: "No active donation channels available"
+ Yellow alert box appears in UI

## Root Cause

The issue occurs when:
1. **No donation channels created** - Database table `donation_channels` is empty
2. **Channels not active** - Channels exist but `is_active = 0`
3. **Channels not attached** - Channels exist but not linked to campaigns in `campaign_donation_channel` table

---

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Create Channels via UI (Recommended)
1. Log in as charity admin
2. Navigate to Charity Dashboard
3. Find "Donation Channels" section
4. Click "Add Channel" button
5. Fill in channel details:
   - Type (GCash, Maya, Bank Transfer, etc.)
   - Account Name
   - Account Number
   - Upload QR Code (optional)
6. Save channel
7. Go to campaign settings
8. Attach channels to campaigns

### Option 2: Quick Database Insert (For Testing)

Run this SQL to create test channels:

```sql
-- Insert sample channels for charity ID 1
INSERT INTO donation_channels (charity_id, type, label, account_name, account_number, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES 
(1, 'gcash', 'GCash - Main Account', 'Juan Dela Cruz', '09123456789', 1, NOW(), NOW()),
(1, 'maya', 'Maya - Main Account', 'Juan Dela Cruz', '09987654321', 1, NOW(), NOW()),
(1, 'bank_transfer', 'BDO - Main Account', 'Charity Foundation Inc.', '1234567890', 1, NOW(), NOW());

-- Attach to campaign 1
INSERT INTO campaign_donation_channel (campaign_id, donation_channel_id)
SELECT 1, id FROM donation_channels WHERE charity_id = 1;

-- Verify
SELECT * FROM donation_channels;
SELECT * FROM campaign_donation_channel;
```

### Option 3: Via API (PowerShell)

See `FIX_DONATION_CHANNELS.md` for API scripts.

---

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### When Channels Exist:
1. Dropdown shows all available channels
2. Each channel displays: "Label (type)"
3. Example: "GCash - Main Account (gcash)"
4. Donor can select and proceed

### When No Channels:
1. Dropdown shows "No channels available"
2. Yellow alert box appears below
3. Message explains the issue
4. Suggests contacting charity
5. Submit button remains disabled (validation)
