   - Full-featured notifications page
   - Mark as read functionality
   - Mark all as read
   - Delete notifications
   - Notification type icons (charity_approved, user_registered, reports, etc.)
   - Proper API integration with backend `/me/notifications` endpoint

2. ✅ Added import to `App.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   import AdminNotifications from "./pages/admin/Notifications";
   ```

3. ✅ Added route to admin routes in `App.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   <Route path="notifications" element={<AdminNotifications />} />
   ```

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ Created: `capstone_frontend/src/pages/admin/Notifications.tsx`
