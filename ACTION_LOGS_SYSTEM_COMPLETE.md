# Action Logs Management System - Complete Implementation

## üéØ Purpose

The Action Logs Management Page allows the System Administrator to monitor and audit all significant user actions performed within the system ‚Äî ensuring **accountability**, **transparency**, and **traceability** of user and charity activity.

Every time a user performs an important action (like logging in, creating a campaign, making a donation, or submitting a report), an entry is automatically recorded in the system logs.

---

## ‚úÖ What Gets Logged

Whenever a user or admin performs one of the following actions, a log entry is automatically inserted into the database (`activity_logs` table):

| Action Name | Description / Example of Trigger |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| **Login** | When a user successfully logs in |
| **Logout** | When a user logs out of the system |
| **Register** | When a new account is created (donor or charity admin) |
| **Create Campaign** | When a charity admin creates a new campaign |
| **Update Campaign** | When a campaign's details or goals are edited |
| **Delete Campaign** | When a campaign is deleted |
| **Make Donation** | When a donor makes a donation (record created) |
| **Update Profile** | When a user edits their profile information |
| **Submit Report** | When a user reports another user or charity |
| **Create Post** | When a charity creates a post/update |
| **Update Post** | When a post is edited |
| **Delete Post** | When a post is deleted |
| **Approve Charity** | When an admin approves a charity registration |
| **Reject Charity** | When an admin rejects a charity registration |
| **Suspend User** | When an admin suspends a user account |
| **Activate User** | When an admin activates a user account |

## üèóÔ∏è Backend Implementation

### Database Structure

**Table:** `activity_logs`

```sql
- id (primary key)
- user_id (foreign key to users table)
- user_role (string: donor, charity_admin, admin)
- action (string: login, logout, create_campaign, etc.)
- details (JSON: additional context about the action)
- ip_address (string: user's IP address)
- user_agent (text: browser/device information)
- session_id (string: session identifier)
- created_at (timestamp)

```

### ActivityLogger Service

**Location:** `capstone_backend/app/Services/ActivityLogger.php`

The `ActivityLogger` service provides static methods to log various user actions:

```php
// Example usage in controllers:
ActivityLogger::logLogin($user, $request);
ActivityLogger::logRegister($user, $request);
ActivityLogger::logDonation($donation, $request);
ActivityLogger::logCreateCampaign($campaign, $request);
ActivityLogger::logUpdateProfile($user, $request);
ActivityLogger::logSubmitReport($report, $request);
```

### API Endpoints

**Base URL:** `/admin/activity-logs`

1. **GET /admin/activity-logs** - Fetch all activity logs with filters
   - Query Parameters:
     - `user_role` (all, donor, charity_admin, admin)
     - `action_type` (all, login, logout, create_campaign, etc.)
     - `target_type` (all, Campaign, Donation, Profile, Report, User)
     - `start_date` (YYYY-MM-DD)
     - `end_date` (YYYY-MM-DD)
     - `search` (search in action, details, user name/email)

2. **GET /admin/activity-logs/statistics** - Get statistics summary
   - Returns:
     - Total actions count
     - Actions today
     - Actions this week
     - Actions this month
