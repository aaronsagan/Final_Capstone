# Transactions Page Removal - Complete

## Reason for Removal
The Transactions page was redundant as the Fund Tracking page already provides comprehensive donation tracking with:
- Donation Records table (shows all donations with donor, charity, campaign, amount, date)
- Fund Usage Logs (shows how funds are utilized)
- Campaign Analytics
- Fund monitoring alerts

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. App.tsx
- ✅ Removed `Transactions` import
- ✅ Removed `/admin/transactions` route

#### 2. AdminSidebar.tsx
- ✅ Removed "Transactions" navigation item
- ✅ Removed unused `ReceiptText` icon import

#### 3. Deleted Files
- ✅ Deleted `src/pages/admin/Transactions.tsx`

### Backend Changes
- ✅ No backend changes needed (no transaction-specific routes or controllers existed)
