## 🎯 Where Donation Channels Are Displayed

### 1. **Main Donation Flow** (`MakeDonation.tsx`)
**Location:** `/donor/donate` (Step 3: Payment)

**Implementation Details:**
- **Step 1:** Donor selects charity and campaign
- **Step 2:** Donor enters donation amount and message
- **Step 3:** Donor sees available donation channels in a dropdown

**Features:**
- ✅ Fetches campaign-specific donation channels via API
- ✅ Falls back to charity-level channels for direct donations
- ✅ Displays channel label and type (e.g., "GCash Account (gcash)")
- ✅ Required field - donation cannot be submitted without selecting a channel
- ✅ Shows "No channels available" message if none exist
- ✅ Validates channel selection before submission

**Code Reference:**
```typescript
// Lines 100-122: Fetching donation channels
const fetchDonationChannels = async (campaignId: number) => {
  const res = await fetch(`${API_URL}/campaigns/${campaignId}/donation-channels`);
  const data = await res.json();
  const list = (data.data || data || []).filter((c: any) => c.is_active);
  setChannels(list);
};

// Lines 601-621: Display in UI
<Select value={formData.channel_used} onValueChange={(v) => setFormData({ ...formData, channel_used: v })}>
  <SelectTrigger>
    <SelectValue placeholder={channels.length ? '💳 Select payment channel' : 'No channels available'} />
  </SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    {channels.map((ch) => (
      <SelectItem key={ch.id} value={ch.label}>{ch.label} ({ch.type})</SelectItem>
    ))}
  </SelectContent>
</Select>
```

)}
```
